    <h1 style="color: blue; border: 1ptx; font-size: xx-large;">My First Week At AkiraChix</h1>
    <p style="color: black; font-size: x-large; border: 1 ptx;">I had an awesome experience joining AkiraChix on 27th December.<br> People who received us were very welcoming and kind.
        The meals are amazing, and the trainers play a key role in helping us understand all we"ve been taught.<br>
        I experienced rollacoster of emotions when i first joined the program.<br> I was excited and the same time missing my previous experiences at work.
        I am greatful to be part of this amazing community.
